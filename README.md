# QuizzApp

This is a simple quiz app in which the user can search and select a quiz, and click on it to answer the questions, and see the results once they've finished. 

I built this app along with a tutorial from Laith Academy on Youtube, while learning the concepts of Vue.js framework.

## What I used...

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Vue.js using Composition API
  - Vue directives
  - Vue watcher and computed properties
  - Vue components, props and emitted events
  - Vue Router
- Git and Github for version control

## What I learned...

I learned a lot about how to work with the new Vue composition API. I also got a good grasp of how to work with different components, passing data down through props and up through emitting events. I really loved learning how to implement a search functionality using conditional rendering, the v-model directive and a watcher. I'd always wonder how that type of search was implemented - where each time you type the results autommatically update.  

All in all, it was a great experience, and I could learn the main concepts that I need to build applications with Vue.js. 

## Resources I used...

This project was built with the help of this video from Youtube Channel Laith Academy:

My thanks to the channel for the excellent learning material.
